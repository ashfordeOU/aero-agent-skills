# Vehicle design domain pack (router)

Route here when the task is aircraft or vehicle conceptual design,
sizing, mass properties, or cost estimation.

## Domain

Vehicle design and integration: class-I weight estimation, takeoff
gross weight estimation, fuselage and empennage sizing, landing gear
sizing, wing loading and thrust to weight matching, mass properties
(moments of inertia, CG envelope), and cost estimation (parametric
CERs, life cycle cost), tied to the sizing loop that brings
aerodynamic, structural, and performance disciplines together.
