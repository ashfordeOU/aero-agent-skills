# Fatigue Cumulative Damage (structures/fatigue/miner-damage)

Use when the task is fatigue life evaluation with cumulative
damage: Palmgren-Miner fractions, life limit checks, and life
consumed reporting.

## Domain quick reference

- The Palmgren-Miner rule sums n/N for each load level, where n is
  applied cycles and N is cycles to failure.
- Failure is predicted when the accumulated fraction reaches 1.0.
- The load spectrum is the sequence of (cycles, cycles-to-failure)
  blocks from the fatigue analysis.
- Fatigue practice sits in the FAR-25.571 damage tolerance context
  for transport aeroplanes.

## Workflow

1. Collect the load spectrum blocks.
2. Sum the damage with cumulative_damage.
3. Check the total with damage_ok.
4. Report life consumed with life_consumed_pct.
5. Gate the fatigue assessment on the verdict.

## Pitfalls

- Summing damage without the cycles-to-failure at each level.
- Using a zero cycles-to-failure for a load block.
- Treating a damage fraction above 1.0 as acceptable.

## Behavior contract (gate 3)

The damage, limit, and life logic is exercised by the gate 3
contract test: scripts/test_miner_damage.py against
scripts/miner_damage_logic.py (stdlib unittest, offline). Run:
python3 scripts/test_miner_damage.py

## Compliance

- Standards referenced, not reproduced: FAR-25 is US government
  work (public domain) and CS-25 is a free EASA download; the
  damage rule is common fatigue methodology, summary-only per
  standards-map.yaml.
- compliance: STANDARDS-REF, gated: false.
