# Spacecraft Sun Pointing (space-systems/adcs/sun-pointing)

Use when the task is spacecraft sun pointing for the ADCS safe hold:
sun vector to pointing axis angle, tolerance checks, illumination,
and sun acquisition slew sizing.

## Domain quick reference

- Units: vectors are dimensionless unit vectors; angles are in
  RADIANS; time is in seconds; slew rate is in rad/s; the solar
  illumination factor is dimensionless, = max(0, cos(angle)).
- Sun pointing angle: acos of the clamped cosine between the sun
  direction vector and the spacecraft pointing axis, in radians.
- Safe hold: the sun pointing angle must stay within the pointing
  tolerance for the sun acquisition phase.
- Solar illumination factor: 1.0 at zero angle, 0.5 at 60 degrees,
  and 0 at or beyond 90 degrees (cosine limit).
- Sun acquisition slew: required_slew_rate = angle / time, rad/s.
- Sun pointing geometry follows ECSS-E-ST-60 ADCS practice.

## Workflow

1. Collect the sun direction vector and the spacecraft pointing axis.
2. Compute the angle with sun_pointing_angle.
3. Check the angle with pointing_within_tolerance.
4. Estimate illumination with solar_illumination_factor.
5. Size the acquisition maneuver with required_slew_rate.
6. Gate the safe hold on the tolerance verdict.

## Pitfalls

- Passing angles in degrees to radian-based functions.
- Zero-norm sun vector (uninitialized ephemeris) raising ValueError.
- Demanding illumination beyond the cosine limit: the factor cannot
  exceed 1.0 at zero angle and is zero at 90 degrees and beyond.

## Behavior contract (gate 3)

The sun pointing angle, tolerance, illumination, and slew logic is
exercised by the gate 3 contract test:
scripts/test_sun_pointing.py against scripts/sun_pointing_logic.py
(stdlib unittest, offline). Run:
python3 scripts/test_sun_pointing.py

## Compliance

- Standards referenced, not reproduced: ECSS-E-ST-60 text is
  copyright ESA; the sun pointing geometry here is common ADCS
  methodology, summary-only per standards-map.yaml (ecss is a free
  ESA download).
- compliance: STANDARDS-REF, gated: false.
