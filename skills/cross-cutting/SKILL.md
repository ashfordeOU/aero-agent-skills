# Cross-cutting domain pack (router)

Route here when the task is the skill format, packaging, or delivery
layer, the standard atmosphere, the engineering documentation layer,
or numerical analysis.

## Domain

Cross-cutting and foundational: the skill-format and delivery
specification (SEP-2640) that governs how this library packages and
serves skills over MCP, skill evaluation, the ISA standard atmosphere
for performance work, unit conversion, the documentation discipline
for engineering reports and margins, and the numerical analysis
discipline (verification, regression, uncertainty propagation,
integration) for engineering calculations.
