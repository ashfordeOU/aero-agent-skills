# DO-178C Development (avionics/do178c/development)

Use when the task is DO-178C development-phase work: turning requirements
into verification-ready source code with complete traceability.

## Domain quick reference

- Development process (DO-178C): high-level requirements -> low-level
  requirements -> source code -> object code, with derived requirements
  identified at each step.
- Bidirectional traceability is required at every software level (A-E):
  high-level requirements to low-level requirements, low-level
  requirements to source code, source code to object code.
- Derived requirements: requirements added during development (design
  decisions, safety analysis output) with no direct higher-level source;
  they must be identified and justified.
- Design and coding standards are project-defined; the process must
  produce the data the standards demand.
- Levels A and B require independent review of development data,
  including the trace matrix.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the software level (DAL) from the planning phase.
2. Capture high-level requirements with unique identifiers; each must be
   verifiable and testable.
3. Derive low-level requirements from the high-level set; flag derived
   items explicitly.
4. Implement source code against the low-level requirements under the
   project coding standard.
5. Build the trace matrix across levels; identify orphans and derived
   items.
6. Gate on traceability closure; levels A/B add independent review.

## Pitfalls

- Derived requirements left unidentified (silent orphans).
- One-way traceability (requirements to code without code to
  requirements).
- Non-verifiable requirements that fail later at verification.
- No coding standard defined before code is written.

## Behavior contract (gate 3)

The traceability-completeness logic is exercised by the gate 3 contract
test: scripts/test_development.py against scripts/development_logic.py
(stdlib unittest, offline). Run: python3 scripts/test_development.py

## Compliance

- Standards referenced, not reproduced: DO-178C / ARP4754A / ARP4761A text
  is proprietary (RTCA/SAE); summary-only per standards-map.yaml and brief 06.
- compliance: STANDARDS-REF, gated: false.
