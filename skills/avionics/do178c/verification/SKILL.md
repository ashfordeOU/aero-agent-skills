# DO-178C Verification (avionics/do178c/verification)

Use when the task is DO-178C verification-phase work: proving the software
meets its requirements and analyzing structural coverage to the depth the
software level demands.

## Domain quick reference

- Verification (DO-178C): review of architecture, design, and code, plus
  requirements-based testing; every requirement is exercised.
- Structural coverage depth scales with level: A = MC/DC, B = decision,
  C = statement, D/E = none required.
- Coverage must reach 100% of the required metric for the level.
- Independence: levels A and B require independent verification; C/D/E
  allow the developer's organization to verify.
- Verification results, problem reports, and coverage analysis are the
  outputs the process must deliver.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the software level and the applicable coverage depth.
2. Review software architecture, design, and code against requirements.
3. Run requirements-based tests; confirm every requirement is exercised.
4. Analyze structural coverage at the required depth (A MC/DC, B
   decision, C statement).
5. Levels A/B: perform the independent verification activities.
6. Produce verification results, coverage analysis, and review records.

## Pitfalls

- Coverage depth mismatched to level (A requires MC/DC, not statement).
- Structural coverage below 100% of the required metric.
- Requirements-based testing without exercising every requirement.
- Missing independence at level A or B.

## Behavior contract (gate 3)

The coverage-depth and independence logic is exercised by the gate 3
contract test: scripts/test_verification.py against
scripts/verification_logic.py (stdlib unittest, offline). Run:
python3 scripts/test_verification.py

## Compliance

- Standards referenced, not reproduced: DO-178C / ARP4754A / ARP4761A text
  is proprietary (RTCA/SAE); summary-only per standards-map.yaml and brief 06.
- compliance: STANDARDS-REF, gated: false.
