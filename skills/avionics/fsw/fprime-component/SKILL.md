# F Prime Component Framework (avionics/fsw/fprime-component)

Use when the task is NASA JPL F Prime (F´) flight software architecture:
component kinds, typed input and output ports, command registration by
opcode, telemetry channels, severity-flagged events, the topology that
connects components, or the rate group schedule that drives them. The
module validates a component model and runs a deterministic clocked
dispatch simulation in pure Python: you define components, connect
producer outputs to consumer inputs, schedule input ports in rate
groups, and the simulation records invocations, deliveries, commands
and telemetry samples with sequence counters, then expands any clean
definition into a scaffold manifest for code generation. F´ is NASA
JPL open-source flight software (github/nasa/fprime, Apache-2.0), a
typed-port framework; the sibling avionics/fsw/cfs-architecture leaf
models NASA cFS, the publish/subscribe software bus framework. The two
mechanisms differ: cFS routes messages by message ID over a central
bus, F´ invokes typed ports along direct point-to-point connections
scheduled by rate groups.

## Domain quick reference

- Component kinds: an active component owns a thread and a message
  queue, so the framework dispatches it; a queued component owns a
  queue without a thread, so its input invocations are dispatched in
  arrival order by the clocked framework; a passive component owns
  neither, so its handlers run inline in the caller context.
- Ports: typed input and output ports carry one payload type from the
  supported set U8/U16/U32/I32/F32/F64/string; an input port may
  declare data_type "serial", a serial interface whose dynamic payload
  matches any partner type. Connections run output to input only.
- Dispatch drivers: every input port of an active or queued component
  must be dispatched by exactly one driver, either one incoming
  connection (data-driven) or membership in exactly one rate group
  (time-driven). A port with zero drivers is orphaned; more than one
  is double dispatch. Passive input ports run inline, so a passive
  port invoked by two rate groups only warns (two timing contexts),
  and a passive port nothing calls is dead code (warning).
- Active rule: an active component must declare at least one input
  port, because the framework can only dispatch it through an input.
  Queued components may be pure command sinks.
- Commands: registered per component with unique opcodes in
  0x0000..0xFFFF and dispatched asynchronously on the command path,
  which requires a queue; passive components must not declare
  commands. Components receive commands by name or opcode.
- Telemetry: declared channels carry typed samples; the simulation
  stamps a monotonic sequence counter per channel, so the ground can
  detect dropped samples. Events carry an F´ style severity from
  (FATAL, HIGH, LOW, INFO, DEBUG).
- Rate groups: a group ticks its listed input ports every period
  derived from base_hz / hz master clock ticks. The master clock runs
  at the fastest declared group rate by default (base_hz = max hz).
- Scaffold manifest: generate_manifest expands a clean definition into
  the class name, header guard, port method stubs, command dispatch
  entries and telemetry channel list a developer would codegen from.
  This proves the model; it is not full F´ code generation.

## Workflow

1. Classify each software unit: active when it needs its own dispatch
   thread, queued when it buffers async input work, passive when it is
   pure logic called inline. Build definitions with
   validate_component (or the component() builder) and fix every
   issue: missing name, unsupported kind, duplicate port names,
   duplicate command opcodes or names, telemetry types outside the
   supported set, event severities outside FATAL/HIGH/LOW/INFO/DEBUG,
   an active component with no input port, or a passive component
   that owns commands.
2. Connect the topology with conn() and validate_connections: every
   connection must run output to input, both ends must exist, data
   types must match (serial interfaces match anything), and self-loops
   are rejected.
3. Schedule dispatch with rate_group() and validate_rate_groups:
   list the input port each group ticks at its hz rate, then check
   the (issues, warnings) pair. Every active or queued input port must
   have exactly one dispatch driver; passive ports invoked from two
   groups or invoked by nothing warn.
4. Run the umbrella check validate_topology over all three artifacts;
   a clean verdict means issues and warnings are both empty (or only
   warnings when passive timing is accepted).
5. Simulate deterministically: build Simulation(defs, connections,
   rate_groups), call run(cycles) for the master clock, then read
   invocations (rate group dispatches), deliveries (connection data
   flow), samples (telemetry with per-channel sequence counters),
   command_log and event_log. Deliver commands with send_command and
   raise declared events with raise_event; record extra telemetry with
   record_telemetry.
6. Codegen from a clean definition: generate_manifest returns the
   scaffold files (model text, header, implementation) plus the
   structured class name, header guard, stubs, dispatch entries and
   channel list.
7. Confirm the deterministic checks with the contract test
   scripts/test_fprime_component.py.

## Worked example

A 1 Hz topology: active SignalGen ticks its run input at 1 Hz and
emits a U32 ramp on tlmOut; queued DataLogger receives each value on
logIn and logs it to telemetry.

```python
import fprime_component_logic as fprime

sg = fprime.component("SignalGen", "active",
    ports=[{"direction": "input", "name": "run", "data_type": "U32"},
           {"direction": "output", "name": "tlmOut", "data_type": "U32"}],
    commands=[{"name": "reset", "opcode": 0x01}],
    events=[{"name": "fault", "severity": "HIGH"}])
dl = fprime.component("DataLogger", "queued",
    ports=[{"direction": "input", "name": "logIn", "data_type": "U32"}],
    telemetry=[{"name": "logIn", "type": "U32"}])

defs = [sg, dl]
conns = [fprime.conn("SignalGen", "tlmOut", "DataLogger", "logIn")]
groups = [fprime.rate_group("1Hz", 1.0, [("SignalGen", "run")])]

fprime.validate_topology(defs, conns, groups)
# {'issues': [], 'warnings': []}
```

Simulation over three master cycles, base clock 1 Hz:

```python
sim = fprime.Simulation(defs, conns, groups)
sim.run(3)
[(i["cycle"], i["comp"], i["port"]) for i in sim.invocations]
# [(0, 'SignalGen', 'run'), (1, 'SignalGen', 'run'), (2, 'SignalGen', 'run')]
[(d["cycle"], d["to_comp"], d["value"]) for d in sim.deliveries]
# [(0, 'DataLogger', 0), (1, 'DataLogger', 1), (2, 'DataLogger', 2)]
[(s["cycle"], s["channel"], s["value"], s["seq"]) for s in sim.samples]
# [(0, 'logIn', 0, 0), (1, 'logIn', 1, 1), (2, 'logIn', 2, 2)]
sim.send_command("SignalGen", "reset")
# {'cycle': 3, 'comp': 'SignalGen', 'name': 'reset', 'opcode': 1}
```

Negative checks: registering a second command with opcode 0x01 raises
the issue "duplicate command opcode 0x0001 (commands 'reset' and
'reboot')"; retyping DataLogger.logIn as F32 raises "connection type
mismatch 'SignalGen.tlmOut' (U32) -> 'DataLogger.logIn' (F32)".

Manifest for SignalGen:

```python
m = fprime.generate_manifest(sg)
m["class_name"]       # 'SignalGenComponent'
m["header_guard"]     # 'SIGNALGEN_COMPONENT_HPP'
[f["path"] for f in m["files"]]
# ['SignalGen.fpp', 'SignalGenComponentBase.hpp', 'SignalGenComponentBase.cpp']
```

## Verification checklist

- Every active component declares at least one input port; passive
  components declare no commands; command opcodes are unique and in
  0x0000..0xFFFF; telemetry types and event severities come from the
  supported sets.
- Every connection runs from a declared output to a declared input
  with matching data types (serial matches any); no dangling
  components or ports; no self-loops.
- Every active and queued input port has exactly one dispatch driver:
  one incoming connection or one rate group. A passive input port in
  two rate groups, or in none, warns.
- Simulation construction raises ValueError listing every topology
  issue, so the clocked loop only ever runs over a clean model.
- run(cycles) is deterministic: invocations and deliveries are
  recorded in schedule order, emitted output values equal the master
  cycle index, and telemetry samples carry a monotonic per-channel
  sequence counter.
- ValueError rejections: Simulation on an invalid topology,
  send_command to an unknown component, unknown command, unknown
  opcode, or a passive component, raise_event on an undeclared event,
  record_telemetry on an undeclared channel or a value that does not
  fit the declared type, and generate_manifest on an unclean
  definition.
- generate_manifest expands a clean definition only, and its header
  guard, port stubs, opcode entries and channel list match the
  definition exactly.

## Behavior contract (gate 3)

The component rules, connection checks, rate group coverage, dispatch
simulation and manifest generator are exercised by the contract test:
scripts/test_fprime_component.py against scripts/fprime_component_logic.py
(stdlib unittest, offline, deterministic). Run:
python3 scripts/test_fprime_component.py
