# Aerodynamics domain pack (router)

Route here when the task is aerodynamic analysis, airfoil selection,
compressible flow, or validation of section data.

## Domain

Aerodynamics and CFD: airfoil section selection, geometry, and
analysis with XFOIL, viscous-inviscid modeling, turbulence modeling,
compressible flow (normal and oblique shocks, Prandtl-Meyer
expansions), drag polar construction, and wing lift curve slope
estimation, validated against classic reference data.
