# Nozzle Design (propulsion/rocket/nozzle-design)

Use when the task is rocket nozzle design from the chamber conditions:
isentropic area ratio, exit Mach number, choked mass flow, exit
velocity, and ideal thrust with the expansion verdict.

## Domain quick reference

- The isentropic area-Mach relation links A/A* to the exit Mach
  number; the supersonic branch (M > 1) is monotonic.
- A choked throat fixes the mass flow from the chamber pressure and
  temperature alone, independent of the downstream pressure.
- Ideal thrust combines the momentum term mdot * ve with the pressure
  term (Pe - Pa) * Ae.
- Overexpanded means Pe < Pa (the pressure term subtracts);
  underexpanded means Pe > Pa; Pe = Pa is optimum.
- Units: every pressure in Pa (chamber P0, exit static Pe, ambient Pa),
  temperature in K, areas in m^2, mass flow in kg/s, velocity in m/s,
  thrust in N.
- ECSS space-systems standards frame the rocket propulsion context.

## Workflow

1. Collect the chamber pressure P0, chamber temperature T0, gamma,
   and specific gas constant R.
2. Pick the target area ratio and solve the exit Mach number with
   exit_mach_from_area_ratio.
3. Compute the choked mass flow with mass_flow.
4. Compute the exit velocity with exit_velocity.
5. Assemble the thrust with ideal_thrust and judge the expansion with
   optimum_expansion.

## Pitfalls

- Inverting the expansion verdict: overexpanded means Pe < Pa, and the
  pressure term (Pe - Pa) * Ae is negative.
- Mixing pressure units (Pa vs MPa) across the chamber, exit, and
  ambient inputs.
- Taking the subsonic root of the area-Mach relation instead of the
  supersonic branch.
- Letting the exit pressure exceed the chamber pressure.
- Dropping the pressure term when the nozzle is not matched to the
  ambient.

## Behavior contract (gate 3)

The area ratio, mass flow, exit velocity, thrust, and expansion logic
is exercised by the gate 3 contract test:
scripts/test_nozzle_design_logic.py against
scripts/nozzle_design_logic.py (stdlib unittest, offline). Run:
python3 skills/propulsion/rocket/nozzle-design/scripts/test_nozzle_design_logic.py

## Compliance

- Standards referenced, not reproduced: ECSS is a free ESA download
  (ecss.nl/standards); isentropic nozzle flow is standard compressible
  flow methodology, summary-only per standards-map.yaml.
- compliance: STANDARDS-REF, gated: false.
